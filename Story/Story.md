## Is Life Really Worth Living
"Hah...here we go again." I sigh as I roll my eyes back.Another day,another problem.I swear...the world must have a vandetta against me,did I wrong them in my last life or something.While having internal monologue,I turn to my prized possession and also my addiction I suppose-my beloved mobile phone,I enter my phone and scrolled to my favourite mindless entertainment-TikTok.Were these short 15 second clips rotting my brain?Yes.But did I always continue?Yes.I live by my motto:if you can't fix the problem,run away from it.Did I have homework and a test to study for? Obviously but when did I ever care.I continued this behaviour for hours on end,only ever stopping for the occasional snack.

The moment I hear my parents' car at the porch,it was almost as if I could sense the toxicity radiating off of them.To me,they were merely adults I was forced to live with,who cares about their abusive behaviour as long as my pockets are filled with gold.I never minded being the problem child,they should honestly be thankful I was smart and had a "bright future".As I drag myself off my bed and start doing my homework,I think back of the golden memories I shared with my primary school classmates,though from their point of view,the memories were how to say...more unpleasant??
