## Is Life Really Worth Living
"Hah...here we go again." I sigh as I roll my eyes back.Another day,another problem.I swear...the world must have a vandetta against me,did I wrong them in my last life or something.While having internal monologue,I turn to my prized possession and also my addiction I suppose-my beloved mobile phone,I enter my phone and scrolled to my favourite mindless entertainment-TikTok.Were these short 15 second clips rotting my brain?Yes.But did I always continue?Yes.I live by my motto:if you can't fix the problem,run away from it.Did I have homework and a test to study for? Obviously but when did I ever care.I continued this behaviour for hours on end,only ever stopping for the occasional snack.

The moment I hear my parents' car at the porch,it was almost as if I could sense the toxicity radiating off of them.To me,they were merely adults I was forced to live with,who cares about their abusive behaviour as long as my pockets are filled with gold.I never minded being the problem child,they should honestly be thankful I was smart and had a "bright future".As I drag myself off my bed and start doing my homework,I think back of the golden memories I shared with my primary school classmates,though from their point of view,the memories were how to say...more unpleasant??

You must be soooooo curious about what I did back then,or not? Who cares,I'll tell you anyway.To make a short story shorter,I may or may not have isolated and bullied a girl to the point she almost tried to kill herself.Anyway back to me,so my newest problem,my puppets oh sorry I meant "friends" have been starting to drift themselves from me.Honestly,thought our little friendship would last longer,guess they couldn't handle it.

Ok this is getting boring,let's spice things up.Did I ever mention that Earth has become a dystopian wasteland after Covid-19 struck.Life got a lot more interesting to say the least,now everyone has a curfew and if you break it,you're shot on sight and Earth suddenly decided to change the genre and go full on fantasy.XXX years ago,our children started developing supernatural abilities and we created a new system,the higher your power,the higher your rank and the more privilege that comes with it.

My parents are one of many with subpar abilities,however,they got lucky and gave birth to my talented sister,she was gifted with one of the strongest powers and fame and power came with that.My parents work at a government lab that is trying to harness the powers of the strongest people and artificially create the strongest human alive.Like I said,I was a problem child,my abilities are only B on the spectrum but what I do have is a high IQ,thus forcing me to work in all sorts of government posts.My newest job is actually experiencing life at my sister's school.Naturally,she goes to the most prestigious schools and while the typical cost of tuition would be millions,she got in on a scholarship.

I already knew the type of people I would meet there,there are only two-bratty rich kids and overpowered children with no control.I was used to the stares of distaste and disgust as I walked down the halls,I know they looked down on me but they would never dare to try harming me.I lived in the hostel there but I come back to the house on the weekends.The lessons taught there mostly consist of the theory of abilities,some history and whole lot of battles.Despite the rigorous curriculum they have there,I know they would never last a day outside that school,especially their lack of life skills and common sense.
