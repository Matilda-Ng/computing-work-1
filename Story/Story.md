## Is Life Really Worth Living
"Hah...here we go again." I sigh as I roll my eyes back.Another day,another problem.I swear...the world must have a vandetta against me,did I wrong them in my last life or something.While having internal monologue,I turn to my prized possession and also my addiction I suppose-my beloved mobile phone,I enter my phone and scrolled to my favourite mindless entertainment-TikTok.Were these short 15 second clips rotting my brain?Yes.But did I always continue?Yes.I live by my motto:if you can't fix the problem,run away from it.Did I have homework and a test to study for? Obviously but when did I ever care.I continued this behaviour for hours on end,only ever stopping for the occasional snack.

The moment I hear my parents' car at the porch,it was almost as if I could sense the toxicity radiating off of them.To me,they were merely adults I was forced to live with,who cares about their abusive behaviour as long as my pockets are filled with gold.I never minded being the problem child,they should honestly be thankful I was smart and had a "bright future".As I drag myself off my bed and start doing my homework,I think back of the golden memories I shared with my primary school classmates,though from their point of view,the memories were how to say...more unpleasant??

You must be soooooo curious about what I did back then,or not? Who cares,I'll tell you anyway.To make a short story shorter,I may or may not have isolated and bullied a girl to the point she almost tried to kill herself.Anyway back to me,so my newest problem,my puppets oh sorry I meant "friends" have been starting to drift themselves from me.Honestly,thought our little friendship would last longer,guess they couldn't handle it.

Ok this is getting boring,let's spice things up.Did I ever mention that Earth has become a utopia,if you can believe that,after Covid-19 struck.Life got a lot more interesting to say the least,now everyone has a curfew and if you break it,you're shot on sight and Earth suddenly decided to change the genre and go full on fantasy.XXX years ago,our children started developing supernatural abilities and we created a new system,the higher your power,the higher your rank and the more privilege that comes with it.I like how I call it new,but it's really just a revamp of the old education system.

My parents are one of many with subpar abilities,however,they got lucky and gave birth to my talented sister,she was gifted with one of the strongest powers and fame and power came with that.My parents work at a government lab that is trying to harness the powers of the strongest people and artificially create the strongest human alive.Like I said,I was a problem child,my abilities are only B on the spectrum but what I do have is a high IQ,thus forcing me to work in all sorts of government posts.My newest job is actually experiencing life at my sister's school or more like monitoring her abilities.Naturally,she goes to the most prestigious schools and while the typical cost of tuition would be millions,she got in on a scholarship.

I already knew the type of people I would meet there,there are only two-bratty rich kids and overpowered children with no control.I was used to the stares of distaste and disgust as I walked down the halls,I know they looked down on me but they would never dare to try harming me.I lived in the hostel there but I come back to the house on the weekends.The lessons taught there mostly consist of the theory of abilities,some history and whole lot of battles.Despite the rigorous curriculum they have there,I know they would never last a day outside that school,especially with their lack of life skills and common sense.

"Hey #@$%#@!"yelled my annoying roommate-Emily.Just as I took off my earpiece,I prepared myself for dissapointment and whole lot of self control.Rolling my eyes,I turn towards Emily,ready for another exciting outburst and shrieking."What is it now...if you're gonna talk to me about my sister,don't."I dragged,annoyed.After hearing that,it was almost as if I could see the second all the excitement in her face get drained,reminds me of a puppy-cute.Emily kinda reminds my of the boot-licking suck ups at my school,except she's too dumb to think of using me.Despite my monotone,I was honestly surprised that my sister had got into another fight.She wasn't stupid,she knew it would do her no good if she starts getting demerit points for her misconduct but she's still too young,too naive,too gullible,too impulsive,that's why she has me,her lovable sister that will straighten her up.

I made my way to the colloseum,where all duels took place.As I took my place,I crunched down the popcorn I had bought and think about the perpetual demise of the boy she was fighting.Honestly,I don't know why I even bother coming when I know she'll decimate him in seconds,she should just get it over with.With dust that threatens to leave me blind gushing towards the audience,everyone knew that the victor of this fight had been decided.As she wipes the glistening sweat off her forehead,she is somehow able to captivate everyone with her beauty despite how sweaty and probably putrid she smells,I mean...that's just Heather.

As she looks up the colloseum presumably looking at me,she wore a certain smugness on her face and confidence in her stride.She probably expects me to cheer for her like every other student at this school.As I made my way out the colloseum,Heather is somehow able to catch up to me and contrary to my previous statement,she smells as fresh as roses,no wonder I could never stand roses."So what's the reason for this fight?"I ask already knowing the answer,"The same as all the others,"she replies with a slightly angry undertone."Wow thanks for caring for me and protecting me from all the slander sis,"I say sarcastically.This was when my sister got really angry,she always hates it when I don't take the "bullying" I get at school seriously,why does she think I do it.

After walking back to the dorms,we split into our respective buildings.She gets to live in her personal mansion with all the other talented individuals while I stay in an apartment,though I like it better this way.I shower and eat dinner before making my way back to my office where I record all the data I've received from my sister's monitors.The government sees my sister as a very valuable specimen and she might get her reawakening anytime soon.Her emotions have been fluctuating lately and her tendency to be reckless is getting worse.After crunching all the numbers and data together,my eyes started drooping and my lolling head hovers above my desk.After finally succumbing to my exhaustion,I lie on my bed ready to sleep and dream of cussing the entire universe.

"Whoosh!"I hear the curtains.Just as I was drifting off into my sleep,some uninvited visitors decided to show up in my room.At that point,I was too tired to deal with anything at 3am,I simply stared at them unbothered and said "Ask whoever who sent you here to find me tommorrow,just say I was too tired to deal with," as I put the covers over me and tried to doze off.
